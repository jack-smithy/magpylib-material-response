Magpylib-Response is an extension to the Magpylib library, providing magnetic
field analysis for soft materials and demagnetization of hard magnets.
Leveraging the Method of Moments ([Chadebec 2006](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2006.870929)), it calculates magnetic material response
with high precision.
